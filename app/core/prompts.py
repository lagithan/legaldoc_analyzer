{risk_assessment_data}

ENTERPRISE SAAS DOCUMENT ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- SaaS/Enterprise agreements typically have 35-60% risk scores due to indemnification, liability caps, and complex terms
- Documents with indemnification clauses should ALWAYS recommend legal review
- Customer indemnification obligations are HIGH RISK and require urgent attention
- Liability limitations, data processing terms, and termination clauses are complex in enterprise agreements
- Enterprise documents over 5,000 words with multiple legal sections need professional review

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the pre-calculated risk_score, reading_time, and confidence_score from the risk_assessment_data
2. For ENTERPRISE/SAAS documents, increase base risk assessment by 15-25%
3. If indemnification is detected, recommend legal review regardless of other factors
4. Base your summary on the ACTUAL legal terms and sections found by the AI models
5. Reference the SPECIFIC risk indicators and urgency signals detected
6. Make the key_clauses specific to the document content analyzed
7. DO NOT use generic or template responses

Based on this comprehensive analysis, provide your expert legal analysis:
